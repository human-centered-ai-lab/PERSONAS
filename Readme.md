# Personas for AI

**_Personas_** have been successful for over two decades in supporting the development of classic user interfaces by mapping users' mental models to specific contexts.  You can find more information about the personas method in <sup name="Nielsen">[[Nielsen]](#footnote100)</sup>.

However, the rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications makes it necessary to create new approaches for future human-AI interfaces. Human-AI interfaces differ from classical human-computer interfaces in many ways, e.g., in that they acquire some degree of human-like cognitive, self-executing, and self-adaptive capabilities and autonomy, and generate unexpected outputs, requiring interactions that are non-deterministic. Furthermore, the most successful AI approaches are so-called "black-box" systems, where the technology and machine learning process are opaque to the user and the AI output is non-intuitive. Thus, when it comes to AI applications, often _causability_ <sup name="a1">[[1]](#footnote1)</sup> is added to the users' needs: Specifically in high-stake domains, such as for example in medicine,  users need to understand the rationale and certainty underlying the results delivered by an AI application. Therefore, in order to achieve useful AI solutions with high usability and causability, **it is essential that AI applications are designed and developed with the users in mind** (human-centered AI). To support such human-centered design and development of AI applications and to help foster the development of novel human-AI interfaces that will be urgently needed in the future, we provide this open available "Personas for AI toolbox". 



# About this Repository
In this repository we describe our approach for persona development to support human-centered design and development of AI applications. We have elaborated a 5-steps approach for developing user personas for AI. Furthermore, based on our experience from practical implementation of the personas development process, we have created free material and tools to facilitate development of user personas for AI. 

This repository "Personas for AI" contains:
* A detailed [step-by-step guide for developing personas for AI](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/Developing_Personas_For_AI-Step-By-Step)  with clear descriptions of the recommended methods and practical hints for implementation.
* Illustrative practical [examples from the field of Digital Pathology](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/tree/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology).
* Ready-to-use [templates for visualising personas](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/tree/main/Persona_Templates) in LaTeX and MS PowerPoint.
* A large set of [pictures of faces](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/tree/main/Resources/Faces), which can be used freely for persona visualisation.
