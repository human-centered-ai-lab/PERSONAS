# Personas for AI


In user-centered design of software applications, the **_personas_ method** is used to keep design and development of the product focused on the users' needs, abilities and preferences in order to create useful products which are usable easily. 

When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) applications, often _causability_ <sup name="a1">[[1]](#footnote1)</sup> is added to the users' needs: Specifically in high-stake domains, such as for example in medicine,  users need to understand the rationale and certainty underlying the results delivered by an AI application. Therefore, it is essential that AI applications are designed and developed with the users in mind, in order to achieve useful AI solutions with high usability and causability.

In order to support user-centered design of AI applications, we have developed a 5-steps approach for developing personas for AI. Furthermore, based on our experience from practical implementation of the personas development process, we have created free material and tools to facilitate development of personas for AI. This repository "Personas for AI" contains:
* a step-by-step guide for personas development
* illustrative examples from practical implementation in the field of Computational Pathology
* clear descriptions of the recommended methods
* useful tools for practical implementation

# Developing Personas for AI: Step-by-Step
We have elaborated a 5-steps process for the development of user personas for AI:
1. Step 1: Identification of (Potential) User Groups
2. Step 2: Collection of Information about the Users
3. Step 3: Consolidation and Analysis of the Collected Information
4. Step 4: Creating the Foundation for Personas
5. Step 5: Visualising Personas

## Step 1: Identification of (Potential) User Groups
**Aim:** Create a comprehensive list of groups of users, who will (potentially) use the AI application. Each of these user groups is the seed for a distinct persona.

**Method:** We recommend to use the well-known method of _brainstorming_ for collecting ideas regarding potential user groups. After the brainstorming session discuss and evaluate the results, and agree on a list of user groups, to form the starting point for the creation of personas.

**Material:**
* [Impulses for Brainstorming](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/brainstorming-impulses.pdf)
* [Example: User Groups for AI Application in Computational Pathology](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/example_identified-user-groups.pdf)

## Step 2: Collection of Information about the (Potential) Users
**Aim:** The aim of this task is twofold: (1) Get to know (potential) users personally --> Learn about their goals, motivations, frustrations, hopes, skills, education, knowledge, personal traits and aspirations. (2) Get to know (potential) use cases --> Learn about the users' tasks and find out in which context they would probably use the AI application.
