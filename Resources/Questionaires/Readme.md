# Questionnaire Templates for Collection of User Information

We would recemmend to use interviews for collection of user information, whenever possible. However, questionnaires can be used for collection of user information, if interviews are not possible, or questionnaires can be used in addition to interviews, as an additional method for collection of user information.

Be aware of the fact that in any survey, where the participants cannot be chosen according to a well planned study design but participants of the survey are those, who volunteer to fill in a questionnaire, a bias is introduced, since those, who participate in such surveys are usually the more technophile and more open minded members of the target group. To tackle this issue, we recommend to include questions about "typical" members of the user group into the survey to obtain an 'indirect' view on the target group from the point of view of their peers.

We provide two questionnaire templates, which were created with [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/), a web application for building and managing online surveys, which is widely used in the sientific community. 

To use one of these templates, download the respective .zip file and upload it as a new instrument into your REDCap <sup>&#x00AE</sup> project.
