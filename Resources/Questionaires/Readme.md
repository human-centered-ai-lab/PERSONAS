# Questionnaire Templates for Collection of User Information

We would recemmend to use interviews for collection of user information, whenever possible. However, questionnaires can be used for collection of user information, if interviews are not possible, or questionnaires can be used in addition to interviews, as an additional method for collection of user information.

Be aware of the fact that in any survey, where the participants cannot be chosen according to a well planned study design but participants of the survey are those, who volunteer to fill in a questionnaire, a bias is introduced, since those, who participate in such surveys are usually the more technophile and more open minded members of the target group. To tackle this issue, we recommend to include questions about "typical" members of the user group into the survey to obtain an 'indirect' view on the target group from the point of view of their peers.

We provide two example questionnaires, which can be used as templates and adapted to your needs. 

* Example **questionnaire type 1** is a long questionnaire designed to cover all thematic aspects of user information needed for persona development. 
* Example **questionnaire type 2** is a short questionnaire, which does not cover all thematic aspects needed for persona development. This questionnaire is designed to be used with complementary research, conducted to obtain those thematic aspects of the neccesary user information that is not covered by the questionnaire.  

These example questionnaires were created with [REDCap&reg;](https://www.project-redcap.org/), a web application for building and managing online surveys, which is widely used in the sientific community. 

**To use one of these example questionnaires as a template, download the respective .zip file and upload it as a new instrument into your REDCap&reg;  project.**
