# Practical Examples from the Field of AI in Digital Pathology

To illustrate the process of persona development for AI, we provide examples from the practical implementation of the process in the field of Digital Pathology. 

* Practical Example from Step 1: Identification of (Potential) User Groups

    * [Example: Identified User Groups for AI in Digital Pathology](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example_identified-user-groups.pdf)

* Practical Example from Step 2: Collection of Information about the Users

    * [Example: Interview Guideline](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example_interview-guideline-QM-diagnostics-institute.pdf)

    * [Example Questionnaires](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/tree/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example-questionnaires)

* Practical Example from Step 4: Creating the Foundation for Personas

    * [Example Foundation Document](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example-foundation-document_QM-diagnostics-institute.pdf)

* Practical Examples from Step 5: Visualising Personas
