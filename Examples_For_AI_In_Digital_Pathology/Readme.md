# Practical Examples from the Field of AI in Digital Pathology

To illustrate the process of persona development for AI, we provide examples from the practical implementation of the process in the field of Digital Pathology. 

### Step 1: Identification of (Potential) User Groups

* [Example: Identified User Groups for AI in Digital Pathology](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example_identified-user-groups.pdf)

### Step 2: Collection of Information about the Users

* [Example: Interview Guideline](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example_interview-guideline-QM-diagnostics-institute.pdf)

* [Example Questionnaires](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/tree/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example-questionnaires)

### Step 3: Consolidation and Analysis of the Collected Information

### Step 4: Creating the Foundation for Personas

* [Example Foundation Document](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/blob/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example-foundation-document_QM-diagnostics-institute.pdf)

### Step 5: Visualising Personas

* [Example Persona Sheets](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/tree/main/Examples_For_AI_In_Digital_Pathology/example-personasheets)
