# Example Persona Sheets from the Field of AI in Digital Pathology

Within the project EMPAIA, we have developed nine personas for AI-solutions in Digital Pathology:

1.	Persona Max, software developer for AI-solutions for Digital Pathology
2.	Persona Ralf, sales person for AI-solutions for Digital Pathology
3.	Persona Klaus, auditor for market admittance / certification of medical products
4.	Persona Joe, researcher in the field of AI
5.	Persona Daniel, researcher in the field of pathology
6.	Persona Su, qualitymanager at pathology institute
7.	Persona Kathrin, AI-technician at patholody institute
8.	Persona Laura, pathologist type 1 in diagnostics
9.	Persona Paul, pathologist type 2 in diagnostics


We have used the [templates for persona sheets](https://github.com/human-centered-ai-lab/PERSONAS/tree/main/Persona_Templates) to visualise these personas, and provide these persona sheets here as practical examples for persona visualisation:
